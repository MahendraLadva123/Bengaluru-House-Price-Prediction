## Overview

This project is a **Bengaluru House Price Prediction** application built with Flask. It allows users to input features such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK configuration to estimate the house price in Bengaluru.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface:** Built with HTML, Bootstrap, and Flask.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Uses a pre-trained model to predict house prices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Leverages a cleaned dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly error messages in case of invalid input.

## 📊 Model Training

The house price prediction model is trained using **Linear Regression**.  
The steps for training are available in `Bengaluru price prediction.ipynb`:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing values, encoding categorical data, handling outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting price per square foot, normalizing data.
- **Training Process**:
  - **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
  - **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
  - **Model Performance**: 
    - **R² Score**: XX.X%
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: X.XX
- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is serialized using `pickle` and stored as `model1.pkl`.
